# monte-carlo-pi-estimation

This notebook demonstrates the Monte Carlo method for estimating Ï€, a basic example of how random sampling can solve deterministic problems. We'll explore:

1. Monte Carlo estimation using the unit circle inscribed in a square
2. Statistical error analysis with confidence intervals
3. Comparison with two alternative methods: Leibniz series and Machin's formula
4. Convergence visualization showing how estimates improve with sample size

The Monte Carlo approach exemplifies the power of probabilistic methods - a concept fundamental to modern AI and machine learning systems.
